# 1. Overview

This document intends to describe the common implementation of the following framework:

   a) some kind of content that tracks activities designed to correspond to competencies 
   described by InLoc and identified by (b).

   b) an activity registry that corresponds xAPI activities to competencies described via InLoc.

   c) a badge issuing system with an LRS that can act as an automatic badge issuer (ABI), collecting 
   statements about one or more people (and/or groups of people) from the content (a) and issuing 
   badges to persons based on information available in (d).

   d) a Badge registry that corresponds the badge(s) to the InLoc described competencies and allows 
   awarding bodies to (per Serge) badge the badgers.

   e) an LRS with backpack(s) associated with it to act as a personal data locker (PDL) for the 
   persons engaged, displaying (and holding the associated metadata for) a badge (d) issued by 
   (c) and the appropriate xAPI Statements related to the badge issued by (a).
